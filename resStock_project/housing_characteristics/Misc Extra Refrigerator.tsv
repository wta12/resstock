# Created by: sources\recs\2009\tsv_maker.py
# Source: Constructed using U.S. EIA 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.
# Source: Age of refrigerator converted to efficiency levels using ENERGYSTAR shipment-weighted efficiencies by year data from Home Energy Score: http://hes-documentation.lbl.gov/. Check the comments in: HES-Refrigerator_Age_vs_Efficiency.tsv
# Assumption: The current year is assumed to be 2020 (previously, it was 2016)
# Assumption: Previously, for each year, the EF values were rounded to the nearest EF level, and then the distribution of EF levels were calculated for the age bins. Currently, each year has its own distribution and then we average out the distributions to get the distribution for the age bins. EF for all years are weighted equally when calculating the average distribution for the age bins.
